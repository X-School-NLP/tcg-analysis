The function `holes_game` takes `input_data`, which is a string of the raw input.\n2. It splits the input into lines and processes the first line to get `N` (number of holes) and `M` (number of moves).\n3. It reads the initial powers of the holes into a list called `powers`.\n4. It then processes each of the next `M` lines:\n   - If the move is of type `0`, it updates the power of the specified hole.\n   - If the move is of type `1`, it simulates the ball being thrown into the hole, counting the jumps and tracking the last hole before it exits the row.\n5. Finally, it collects the results and returns them as a formatted string.\n\nThis solution is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be efficient for larger inputs due to potentially high time complexity from the jump simulation.", "inputs": ["10 10\n5 1 2 4 1 7 3 8 10 8\n0 5 6\n1 8\n1 1\n0 10 3\n1 5\n1 3\n1 2\n0 6 1\n1 9\n1 1\n", "10 10\n5 1 2 8 1 7 3 8 10 8\n0 5 6\n1 8\n1 1\n0 10 3\n1 5\n1 3\n1 2\n0 6 1\n1 9\n1 1\n", "8 5\n1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2\n1 1\n0 1 3\n1 1\n0 3 4\n1 2\n"], "expected_outputs": ["8 1\n6 2\n5 1\n5 2\n5 3\n9 1\n10 4\n", "8 1\n6 2\n5 1\n5 2\n5 3\n9 1\n10 4\n", "7 7\n7 5\n7 3\n"], "generated_outputs": ["8 1", "6 2", "5 1"], "confusion_matrix": {"true_positives": 0, "true_negatives": 0, "false_positives": 3, "false_negatives": 0, "accuracy": 0.0, "precision": 0.0, "recall": 0.0, "f1_score": 0.0, "specificity": 0.0, "total_samples": 3}}
