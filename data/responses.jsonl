Specifically:\n- $T_i$ represents the total distinct water levels (marks) from day 1 to day $i$.\n- For each day $i$, $T_i = m_i + d_i + 1$, which rearranges to $d_i = T_i - m_i - 1$.\n- The sum of $d_i$ over all days is $\\sum (T_i - m_i - 1) = (\\sum T_i) - (\\sum m_i) - n$.\n\nThus, minimizing the sum of $d_i$ reduces to minimizing $\\sum T_i$, since $\\sum m_i$ and $n$ are fixed.\n\n### Constraints on $T_i$\n1. **Non-decreasing $T_i$**: $T_i \\geq T_{i-1}$ because the number of distinct marks can only stay the same or increase each day.\n2. **Minimum $T_i$ from $m_i$**: $T_i \\geq m_i + 1$ because there must be at least $m_i$ marks above the water level plus the water level itself.\n3. **Future constraints**: For any future day $j > i$, $T_j \\leq T_i + (j - i)$ (since at most one new mark can be added per day).

The challenge lies in processing these operations efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of holes (N) and the number of operations (M) can be as large as 100,000. A naive approach of simulating each jump step-by-step for every query would be too slow, so we use a technique called sqrt decomposition to optimize the operations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the path of a ball thrown into a hole, where each hole's power determines the next hole the ball jumps to. The ball exits the row when it jumps beyond the last hole. For each query, we need to output the last hole visited before exiting and the total number of jumps made.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Since each hole's jump always moves to a higher-indexed hole (or exits), the structure forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with edges pointing right. This allows us to process nodes from right to left for efficient path computation.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use sqrt decomposition to divide the holes into blocks of size approximately \u221aN.

The key observation is that the first element of the new deck has the highest weight (since it's multiplied by $n^{n-1}$), so we should prioritize placing the largest possible values in the earliest positions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The operation allowed is repeatedly taking the top $k$ cards from the original deck and placing them on top of the new deck.
