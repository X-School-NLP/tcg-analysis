The first line gives us the number of holes (`N`) and the number of moves (`M`). The second line contains the initial powers of the holes.\n\n2. **Processing Moves**:\n   - For a command of type `0 a b`, we simply update the power of hole `a` to `b`. Since the hole indices are 1-indexed in the input but Python uses 0-indexing, we adjust by subtracting 1.\n   - For a command of type `1 a`, we simulate the ball's movement starting from hole `a`. We follow the jumps as defined by the current hole's power until the ball exits the row. We count the number of jumps and track the last hole visited.\n\n3. **Output**: For each type `1` command, we store the results and print them all at once at the end.\n\nThis solution is straightforward and guarantees correctness for small inputs, but it may not be efficient for larger inputs due to the potential for many jumps depending on the values of the powers.", "inputs": ["10 10\n5 1 2 4 1 7 3 8 10 8\n0 5 6\n1 8\n1 1\n0 10 3\n1 5\n1 3\n1 2\n0 6 1\n1 9\n1 1\n", "10 10\n5 1 2 8 1 7 3 8 10 8\n0 5 6\n1 8\n1 1\n0 10 3\n1 5\n1 3\n1 2\n0 6 1\n1 9\n1 1\n", "8 5\n1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2\n1 1\n0 1 3\n1 1\n0 3 4\n1 2\n"], "expected_outputs": ["8 1\n6 2\n5 1\n5 2\n5 3\n9 1\n10 4\n", "8 1\n6 2\n5 1\n5 2\n5 3\n9 1\n10 4\n", "7 7\n7 5\n7 3\n"], "generated_outputs": ["", "", ""]}

Tanya can start eating candies from box 3. Next, she can move to either box 2 or box 4.\n3. If she eats from box 3 (3 candies), she can then move to box 2 (1 candy, color 'R') since the color changes. This takes 1 second.\n4. After eating from box 2 (1 candy), she can move back to box 3 (which she cannot eat again) or go to box 4.\n5. Moving to box 4 (4 candies, color 'G') is valid since the color changes and the number of candies is more than the last box. This takes another second.\n6. After eating from box 4 (4 candies), she has eaten a total of \\( 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 \\) candies. She must now move to box 5 (5 candies, color 'R'), which takes 1 more second.\n7. Finally, eating from box 5 (5 candies) will make her total \\( 3 + 1 + 4 + 5 = 13 \\), which exceeds \\( k = 10 \\).\n8. Total time spent: \\( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\) seconds (moving to boxes 2, 4, and 5).\n9. Since she started at box 3, she also needs to account for the initial position, resulting in a total of \\( 4 \\) seconds.\n\n**Expected Output:** `4`\n\n### Test Input 2:\n**Input:**\n```\n2 1 15\n5 6\nRG\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Initial Position:** Box 1 (5 candies, color 'R').\n2. Tanya can eat from box 1 (5 candies).\n3. Next, she can only move to box 2 (6 candies, color 'G') since she can\u2019t eat from the same color box again.\n4. After eating from box 2 (6 candies), her total becomes \\( 5 + 6 = 11 \\).\n5. Tanya needs to eat at least \\( k = 15 \\) candies. There are no more boxes to eat from, and she cannot move back to box 1 (same color).\n6. Therefore, she cannot reach the required amount of candies.\n\n**Expected Output:** `-1`\n\n### Test Input 3:\n**Input:**\n```\n6 1 21\n4 2 3 5 1 6\nRGBGRB\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Initial Position:** Box 1 (4 candies, color 'R').\n2. Tanya can eat from box 1 (4 candies).\n3. She can move to box 2 (2 candies, color 'G'). Eating from box 2 is valid since the color changes. Total now is \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\).\n4. Next, she can only move to box 3 (3 candies, color 'B'). Eating from box 3 is valid and the total candies now is \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\).\n5. Moving to box 4 (5 candies, color 'G') is valid. Total becomes \\( 9 + 5 = 14 \\).\n6. She can then move to box 5 (1 candy, color 'R'). This cannot be eaten as it\u2019s not increasing.\n7. Finally, she can move to box 6 (6 candies, color 'B'). This is valid as it\u2019s a different color and has more candies than the last eaten box. Total becomes \\( 14 + 6 = 20 \\).\n8. However, to reach at least \\( k = 21 \\), she must move back to box 4, which is invalid.\n9. Therefore, we can conclude that Tanya cannot reach the required number of candies.\n\n**Expected Output:** `-1`\n\nHowever, she can also try a different route: \n1. Eat from box 1 (4 candies), then box 2 (2 candies), and box 4 (5 candies). Total is 11. Then move to box 6 (6 candies). Total now 17, which is still less than 21.
